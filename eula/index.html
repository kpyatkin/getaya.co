                        usage information; and (4) to receive 7room informational messages. You can view sample data to

                <h2>The Agreement</h2>
                <p>By downloading, installing, using, or copying the Software, you accept and agree to be bound by the

                <h2>Privacy Notices</h2>
                <p>The Software automatically communicates with 7room servers for four purposes: (1) sending an
                    optional license key and receiving license; (2) sending error reports; (3) sending anonymized usage
                    data so we may improve the Software; and (4) receiving 7room informational messages. You may opt
                    out of sending the anonymized usage data, but if you do not want the Software to check for updates
                    automatically or send error reports, you must uninstall the Software.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Automatic Software Update Checking. The Software communicates with GitHub API to determine
                        whether there are any patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades or other modifications to improve
                        the Software. You agree that the Software may automatically check for any such improvements to
                        the Software on your computer without providing any further notice or receiving any additional
                        consent. This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to automatically check for
                        updates, you must uninstall the Software.</li>
                    <li>Error Reports. In order to help us improve the Software, when the Software encounters certain
                        errors, it will automatically send some information to 7room about the error. This feature may
                        not be disabled. If you do not want to send error reports to 7room, you must uninstall the
                        Software.</li>
                    <li>Anonymized Usage Data. 7room collects anonymized data about your usage of the Software to help
                        us make it more awesome. If you do not want to send anonymized usage data to 7room, you may opt
                        out by changing your settings in the Preferences view.</li>
                </ol>
